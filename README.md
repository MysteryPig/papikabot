This is Galactic Balex's Discord Bot. It is written using discord.py (and python). Its primary purpose is to annoy my friends by sending a message every time they do.


Commands:

{modme - makes you the moderator of the bot and makes sure people can't use the commands that you want.

{lockme - tells the bot to respond to you.

{lock - locks whoever is @'d in the message.

{unlockme - the bot will stop responding to you.

{unlock - the bot will stop responding to anyone.

{toggle - the bot will stop responding, but will still remember who it is watching.

{add - opens a vote to add a quote to the bot's list of responses.

{leaderboard - shows the people with the most points.

{help - displays the help text.

{pat - pats someone.

{shove - gives you the option to shut down the bot.



Reaction Responses:

scales - same as {add.

shallow_pan_of_food - gives someone a point for their message (unless you do it to yourself)
